  "description": "Improve CLI ergonomics for agents and scripting with standardized JSON output, quiet mode, and bulk operations.\n\n## Goal\nMake jit CLI more agent-friendly and scriptable by standardizing output formats and adding bulk operation support.\n\n## Tasks\n- Standardize JSON output format across all commands\n- Add --quiet flag for scripting workflows\n- Support bulk operations for gates, labels, and dependencies\n\n## Success Criteria\n- All commands with --json flag use consistent JsonResponse envelope\n- --quiet flag suppresses decorative output while preserving essential data\n- Broken pipe errors handled gracefully\n- Bulk operations work atomically\n\n## Benefits\n- Easier to script and automate\n- Better MCP integration\n- Reduced command count for common workflows\n- Improved agent experience",
