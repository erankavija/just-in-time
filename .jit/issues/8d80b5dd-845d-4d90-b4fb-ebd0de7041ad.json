  "title": "Create performance benchmark suite",
  "description": "Establish performance baselines for the issue tracker at scale using criterion.rs benchmark suite. Create realistic test scenarios with 1000+ issues and complex dependency graphs. Measure query operations (list, filter, search), graph exports, bulk operations, and gate execution overhead. Set performance targets (queries <100ms, graph export <500ms, bulk ops <1s for 100 issues). Generate performance plots showing scaling characteristics and document results in docs/performance.md. Add benchmark CI job to track performance over time and detect regressions. These benchmarks validate production readiness claims and ensure acceptable performance at scale, providing confidence for v1.0 release.",
