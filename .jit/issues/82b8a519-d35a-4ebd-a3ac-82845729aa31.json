  "title": "FIX: Precheck gate enforcement not working on claim",
  "description": "Investigation revealed that this bug was already fixed in commit f457d23 (Fix claim_issue to enforce precheck gates). The issue #4ae60108 was claimed using an older binary before the fix was applied. Current code correctly enforces precheck gates on claim - test test_claim_issue_enforces_prechecks passes. Verified with fresh test in /tmp showing old binary allows claim while new binary properly rejects it.",
