  "title": "Implement gate templates and presets",
  "description": "Implement gate templates and presets system to reduce setup time and encode best practices for common workflows. Add 'jit gate preset' commands: list (show available presets), show (display preset details), apply (create gates from preset on issue), and create (save custom presets). Include built-in presets for rust-tdd, python-tdd, js-tdd, security-audit, and minimal workflows, embedding proven gate configurations directly in binary. Support custom user-defined presets in .jit/config/gate-presets/. Enable customization via parameters when applying presets (timeout overrides, skip prechecks/postchecks, include/exclude specific gates). This feature dramatically improves onboarding and reduces boilerplate, enabling users and agents to set up quality gates in seconds rather than minutes by leveraging battle-tested configurations.",
