  "title": "Epic: AI Agent Validation",
  "description": "Systematically validate the entire just-in-time system with real AI agents (Claude, GitHub Copilot) to ensure production readiness for agent orchestration workflows. This epic encompasses comprehensive testing of gate system usability, MCP tool coverage, documentation adequacy, workflow efficiency (token usage, tool calls), and multi-agent coordination. Since the system is explicitly designed for programmatic agent orchestration, empirical validation with real AI agents is critical before claiming v1.0 production readiness. Testing will identify and fix bugs, documentation gaps, and UX friction that would block agent adoption.",
