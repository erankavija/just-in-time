  "title": "Reorganize active docs into domain-agnostic structure",
  "description": "Create domain-agnostic directory structure and move active documentation to appropriate categories. Uses neutral naming that works for software, research, knowledge work, and any project type.\n\n## Rationale\n\nJIT is not just for software development - it supports research projects, knowledge management, and general work tracking. Directory names should be domain-agnostic:\n-  not  - works for experiments, analyses, drafts, features\n-  not  - works for methodology, background, principles\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- Create directory structure:\n  -  (permanent user-facing docs)\n  -  (work-in-progress linked to active issues)\n  -  (permanent reference material)\n  -  (future plans)\n- Move files to appropriate directories:\n  - **guides/**: file-locking-usage.md, research-workflow-examples.md\n  - **active/**: Keep currently linked active design docs\n  - **reference/**: cli-and-mcp-strategy.md, web-ui-architecture.md, graph-filtering-architecture.md, json-schema-api.md, search-implementation.md\n  - **vision/**: knowledge-management-vision.md, document-graph-implementation-plan.md, document-viewer-implementation-plan.md\n- Update internal links in moved files\n- Verify no broken links\n\n## Active Docs (keep in docs/active/)\n\nCurrently linked to active/recent epics:\n- ci-gate-integration-design.md (active epic)\n- gate-examples.md (active epic)\n- rejection-state-design.md (recently completed, keep per retention policy)\n- observability-design.md (active epic)\n- production-stability-design.md (active epic)\n- production-polish-design.md (active epic)\n- agent-validation-design.md (active epic)\n- file-locking-design.md (foundational)\n- storage-abstraction.md (foundational)\n- design.md (core design - rename to core-system-design.md)\n- documentation-lifecycle-design.md (this epic)\n- documentation-lifecycle-strategy.md (this epic)\n\n## Developer Docs (keep in root docs/)\n\nThese stay at root docs/ level:\n- architecture-pitfalls.md (developer reference)\n- clippy-suppressions.md (developer reference)\n- example-config.toml (configuration example)\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n- New domain-agnostic structure created\n- All active docs moved appropriately\n- No broken links\n- Clear separation: permanent vs active vs vision",
