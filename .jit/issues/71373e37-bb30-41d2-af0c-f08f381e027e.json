  "description": "Establish comprehensive documentation lifecycle and knowledge management system with proper asset handling, link integrity, and snapshot export capabilities. This epic addresses the current problem where docs/ mixes active guides, design specs, implementation records, and session notes (54 files), has no asset management, and lacks tooling to safely archive documentation as the project grows.\n\n## Problem Statement\n\n**Current Issues:**\n- 54 files in docs/ mixing active guides, historical records, session notes\n- 20+ historical docs from before jit dogfooding (not linked to issues)\n- No lifecycle for design docs (accumulate forever in docs/)\n- **No asset management** - images, diagrams not tracked\n- **No link integrity** - archival can break links\n- Duplication (4+ docs on labels/hierarchy)\n- No portable export capability\n\n**Critical Gap:** Documentation with images/diagrams has no safety net. Moving docs can break relative links to assets.\n\n## Solution: Comprehensive Knowledge Management\n\n### Three-Stage Document Lifecycle\n1. **Active** (docs/design/) - Linked to in-progress issues\n2. **Recent** (docs/design/) - Completed, kept 1-2 releases for reference  \n3. **Archived** (.jit/docs/archive/) - Moved after retention period\n\n### Asset Management (Critical Addition)\n- Track binary assets (images, diagrams) per document\n- Classify as per-doc vs shared assets\n- Co-move assets with docs during archival\n- Validate and preserve link integrity\n- Support external URLs and LFS pointers\n\n### Format-Agnostic Architecture\n- Pluggable adapter system for document formats\n- Built-in: Markdown, AsciiDoc, reStructuredText, MDX\n- Each adapter handles format-specific link syntax\n- Extensible for future formats\n\n### Snapshot Export (New Capability)\n- Export complete issue + docs + assets as portable archive\n- Reproducible at any commit (git-accurate)\n- Manifest with provenance and integrity hashes\n- Critical for handoffs, audits, compliance\n\n### Configurable Policies\n- Manual mode (default) vs automated archival\n- Configurable retention periods\n- Safety levels (strict/loose/permissive)\n- Per-format adapter toggles\n\n## Proposed Structure\n\n\n\n## Archive Policy by Category\n\n| Category | Archive? | When |\n|----------|----------|------|\n| User Guides | NEVER | Permanent, update in place |\n| Architecture | RARELY | Only if major redesign |\n| Development | NEVER | Permanent reference |\n| Feature Designs | YES | 1-2 releases after completion |\n| Bug Analyses | YES | Immediately after fix |\n| Session Notes | YES | Immediately (or use issue context) |\n| Visions | YES | When implemented/rejected |\n\n## Scope - Phased Delivery\n\n### Phase 0: Manual Cleanup (v1.0, 3-4 hours)\nFrom original strategy - immediate cleanup:\n- Archive 20+ pre-jit historical docs to .jit/docs/archive/pre-jit/\n- Archive 3 completed bug analyses to .jit/docs/archive/bug-fixes/\n- Reorganize active docs into guides/design/architecture/development/vision/\n- Consolidate duplicates (label docs, agent docs)\n- Create docs/README.md with archive policy and authoring conventions\n- Update root README.md links\n- Remove obsolete docs (auth-design.md, billing-design.md)\n\n### Phase 1: Asset Management Foundations (v1.0, 1-2 weeks)\nFrom design Phase 1 - critical for production use:\n- Format adapter registry + Markdown adapter\n- Asset discovery and scanning\n- Extend document metadata with assets[] and format\n-  - inspect assets\n-  - validate link integrity\n- Manual  with per-doc asset co-move\n- Basic snapshot export (dir/tar format)\n- Document authoring conventions (per-doc assets pattern)\n\n### Phase 2: Ergonomics & Automation (v1.1)\nFrom design Phase 2:\n-  - normalize to per-doc layout\n- Link rewriting engine\n-  - batch archive candidates\n- AsciiDoc adapter\n- LFS pointer handling\n\n### Phase 3: Advanced Features (v1.2+)\nFrom design Phase 3:\n- External asset download for snapshots\n- MDX/reStructuredText adapters (opt-in)\n- Performance optimizations\n- Shared asset detection cache\n\n## Out of Scope (Future)\n\n- WYSIWYG authoring\n- Rendering/publishing pipelines\n- Cross-repo document dependencies\n- Automated adapter plugins\n\n## Benefits\n\n1. **Safety** - Never break links during archival\n2. **Completeness** - Docs + assets tracked together\n3. **Portability** - Snapshot export for handoffs\n4. **Scalability** - Clean docs/ won't accumulate 100s of files\n5. **Flexibility** - Multi-format support, not Markdown-only\n6. **Dogfooding** - Uses jit's document tracking\n7. **Professionalism** - Proper asset handling, link validation\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n**Phase 0:**\n- docs/ reduced from 54 to ~25 active files (52% reduction)\n- No duplicate content\n- Clear navigation via docs/README.md\n- Archive policy documented\n\n**Phase 1:**\n- Asset tracking operational\n- Link validation prevents broken archival\n- Snapshot export working\n- Authoring conventions established\n- Zero broken links after archival\n\n**Phase 2+:**\n- Automated sweep operational\n- Multi-format support\n- LFS handling\n\n## Implementation Estimates\n\n- Phase 0: 3-4 hours (manual cleanup)\n- Phase 1: 1-2 weeks (asset foundations)\n- Phase 2: 1 week (automation)\n- Phase 3: 2-3 weeks (advanced features)\n\nTotal for v1.0 (Phase 0+1): ~2 weeks\n\n## Design Documents\n\nSee linked documents for detailed specifications:\n- documentation-lifecycle-design.md - Authoritative comprehensive design\n- documentation-lifecycle-strategy.md - Initial strategy (superseded by design)",
