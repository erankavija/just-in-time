  "description": "## Bug Description\n\nWhen creating an issue with `jit issue create --description` containing code blocks with commands/JSON, the description gets corrupted with actual command output embedded in it.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Create an issue with description containing backtick-quoted commands like:\n   - `jit issue update 9112af40 --state done --json`\n   - JSON code blocks with issue data\n2. The resulting issue description has actual command output inserted\n3. Updating the description with `jit issue update --description` shows the same corruption\n\n## Example\n\nAttempted to create issue f0b27778 with proper markdown description containing:\n- Code blocks with example commands\n- JSON examples\n- Structured sections\n\nResult: Description filled with actual `jit issue show` output instead of the markdown text.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n- Issue description stored exactly as provided\n- Code blocks treated as literal text, not executed\n- No command substitution or interpretation\n\n## Actual Behavior\n\n- Commands in backticks appear to be executed or substituted\n- JSON examples get replaced with actual issue data\n- Description becomes unreadable\n\n## Workaround\n\nUse simple descriptions without code blocks or complex markdown. Tested creating issue b6aeb05b with simple text - worked correctly.\n\n## Impact\n\n- Cannot document bugs with reproduction steps containing commands\n- Cannot include JSON examples in issue descriptions\n- Limits usefulness of issue descriptions for technical bugs\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- Issue descriptions with code blocks preserved exactly\n- Backtick-quoted text not interpreted as commands\n- JSON code blocks stored as literal text\n- Test coverage for markdown in descriptions",
