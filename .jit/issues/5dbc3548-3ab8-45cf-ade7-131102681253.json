  "title": "Bug: Issue deletions not immediately reflected in query/validate operations",
  "description": "When deleting issues with `jit issue delete`, the changes are not immediately reflected in `jit query` and `jit validate` commands until the deletions are committed to git.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n1. Create test issues: `jit issue create -t \"Test Issue\"`\n2. Delete the issue: `jit issue delete <id>`\n3. Run validation: `jit validate`\n4. Run query: `jit query all`\n\n## Expected Behavior\n- Deleted issues should immediately disappear from all query operations\n- Validation should not see deleted issues\n- JIT should operate on current filesystem state\n\n## Actual Behavior\n- Deleted issue files are removed from `.jit/issues/`\n- BUT `jit query all` still returns the deleted issues\n- AND `jit validate` still validates against deleted issues\n- Issues only disappear after committing the deletions to git\n\n## Root Cause\nThe storage layer appears to be reading from git's index/tree rather than the actual filesystem state.\n\n## Why This is a Problem\n1. JIT should work independently of git (git integration is optional)\n2. Users expect immediate consistency - delete should mean deleted everywhere\n3. Creates confusion when validation fails on issues that were just deleted\n4. Violates principle of least surprise\n\n## Impact\n- **Severity**: Medium\n- **Frequency**: Every time issues are deleted\n- **User Experience**: Confusing and frustrating\n\n## Suggested Fix\nThe storage layer should always read from the filesystem first, not from git. Git should only be used for optional version tracking, not as the primary data source.",
