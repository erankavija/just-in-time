  "title": "Issue Lifecycle - Rejection State",
  "description": "Add 'Rejected' terminal state to properly handle issues that won't be implemented, eliminating the need to pass gates for rejected work. Current workaround requires passing all gates even for won't-fix issues, which is semantically incorrect (done implies success). The Rejected state will bypass gate enforcement and provide clear distinction between successful completion (Done) and non-implementation (Rejected). Optional resolution:* labels provide detailed closure reasons.",
