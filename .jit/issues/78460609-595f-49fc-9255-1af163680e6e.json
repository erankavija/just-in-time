  "title": "Prevent manual pass/fail of automated gates",
  "description": "Automated gates (mode=auto) should only be passable via their checker command execution (jit gate check). Currently, you can manually pass automated gates like fmt/tests/clippy with 'jit gate pass', which defeats the purpose of automation. Add validation in pass_gate/fail_gate to reject manual operations on automated gates. Users should use 'jit gate check' instead, which runs the checker and auto-passes/fails based on exit code.",
