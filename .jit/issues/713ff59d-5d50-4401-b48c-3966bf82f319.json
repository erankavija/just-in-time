  "title": "Implement metrics reporting system",
  "description": "Implement comprehensive metrics reporting system providing actionable insights into issue tracker state and workflow performance. Add 'jit metrics' command with support for multiple categories: issue state distribution, workflow velocity (throughput, cycle time, lead time, WIP), gate performance (pass rates, execution times), and dependency graph health. Support time range filtering (since date, last N days) and multiple output formats (JSON, Prometheus, CSV). Parse event logs for historical data and calculate key metrics like average cycle time from ready→done, gate pass rates by gate type, and blocking time distributions. Include Prometheus export format for integration with monitoring infrastructure. This feature provides essential observability for production deployments, enabling data-driven decisions and early detection of workflow issues.",
