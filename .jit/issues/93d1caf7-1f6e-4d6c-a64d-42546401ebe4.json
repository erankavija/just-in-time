  "title": "Add gate modification flags to issue update command",
  "description": "Add --add-gate and --remove-gate flags to 'jit issue update' command to enable gate modification without requiring separate 'jit gate add/remove' commands, matching the existing pattern for labels (--label/--remove-label). This creates API consistency and improves UX for both humans and AI agents. Implementation should support multiple gates in a single command (e.g., --add-gate tests --add-gate clippy), validate gate keys against the registry before adding, and return clear error messages for non-existent gate keys. Update the command to accept both comma-separated values and multiple flag instances for consistency with create command. Ensure JSON output includes the updated gates_required array. Add comprehensive tests covering: adding single/multiple gates, removing gates, combining with other update operations (state, labels, etc.), error cases (invalid gate keys, adding duplicates). Update MCP server schema to expose these new parameters. This change eliminates the asymmetry between create (has --gate) and update (currently requires separate gate commands), making the CLI more intuitive and reducing the number of commands needed for common workflows.",
