  "description": "Create docs/README.md with clear navigation, archive policy, and authoring conventions. Establish patterns for asset management and document lifecycle.\n\n## Rationale\n\nDocumentation needs clear navigation and authoring conventions, especially for asset management (images, diagrams). This establishes patterns that Phase 1 asset management will validate and enforce.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n### 1. Create docs/README.md\n\nInclude sections:\n\n**Organization Overview:**\n- Documentation structure explanation\n- Directory purpose (guides, active, reference, vision)\n- Domain-agnostic approach (works for software, research, knowledge work)\n\n**Archive Policy:**\n- When documents get archived\n- Archive categories and their use\n- Retention periods (1-2 releases for active docs)\n- How to find archived docs (jit search)\n\n**Authoring Conventions (Critical for Phase 1):**\n- **Per-doc assets pattern:**\n  - For , create \n  - Link relatively: \n  - Co-move with doc during archival\n- **Shared assets pattern:**\n  - Place in \n  - Link with root-relative: \n  - Remain when docs archive\n- **External assets:**\n  - Document external URLs (will be handled specially in snapshots)\n\n**Project-Specific Conventions:**\n- This is a software development project section\n- Show how we use active/ (feature designs)\n- Show how we use reference/ (architecture, design principles)\n- Our archive categories (features, bug-fixes, refactorings, sessions)\n\n**Multi-Domain Examples:**\n- Show research project example conventions\n- Show knowledge work example conventions\n\n**Search and Discovery:**\n- How to search: No matches found for \"term\"\n- How to find doc from issue: \n- How to view archived docs: \n\n**Links:**\n- Link to documentation-lifecycle-design.md for full design\n- Link to documentation-lifecycle-strategy.md for implementation strategy\n\n### 2. Update Root README.md\n\n- Update documentation section with new structure\n- Link to docs/README.md for navigation\n- Reflect domain-agnostic approach\n- Update all documentation links\n\n### 3. Validation\n\n- All links working\n- No broken references\n- Clear navigation from root README → docs/README.md → specific docs\n- Authoring conventions clearly explained\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n- docs/README.md comprehensive and clear\n- Asset authoring patterns documented\n- Multi-domain examples included\n- Root README.md updated\n- All links verified",
