  "title": "Bug: worktree list shows stale active_claims count after lease expiry",
  "description": "## Problem\n\n`jit worktree list` reports `active_claims: 1` for a worktree after its lease has expired, while `jit claim list` correctly returns 0 leases. The `active_claims` count in worktree list is not reconciled against actual live leases.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Acquire a lease on an issue (`jit claim acquire <issue>`)\n2. Wait for the TTL to expire (default 600s)\n3. Run `jit worktree list` — shows `active_claims: 1`\n4. Run `jit claim list` — shows 0 leases\n5. Run `jit recover` — evicts the stale lease, after which `jit worktree list` correctly shows `active_claims: 0`\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n`jit worktree list` should not count expired leases. Either:\n- **Eager**: Evict leases on TTL expiry automatically\n- **Lazy**: Filter out expired leases when computing `active_claims` in `worktree list`\n\n## Workaround\n\nRun `jit recover` to clean up stale leases manually.",
