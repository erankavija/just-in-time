  "title": "Add search result focus navigation to DAG",
  "description": "Enhance issue search to automatically focus on search results in the DAG visualization. When a search result is clicked:\n\n1. **Center the DAG** on the found issue node\n2. **Expand all collapsed clusters** in the path to make the issue visible\n\nAlso added a 'Focus in Graph' button to the issue detail panel for quick navigation.\n\nImplementation:\n- Search result click handler extracts issue ID and triggers focus\n- Graph expansion logic recursively expands parent clusters (handles nested hierarchies)\n- ReactFlow viewport centering using fitView\n- Generic focusNodeId API enables reuse from multiple UI components (search, detail panel)\n\nImproves UX by eliminating manual navigation after search or when viewing issue details.",
