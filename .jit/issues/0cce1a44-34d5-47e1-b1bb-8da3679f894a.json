  "title": "Fix strategic query to check type label, not membership labels",
  "description": "Current bug: query_strategic() returns any issue with epic:* or milestone:* labels, which incorrectly includes tactical tasks that belong to epics/milestones.\n\nExpected behavior: Only issues with type:epic or type:milestone should be strategic.\n\nRoot cause: Strategic query checks if issue has ANY label from strategic namespaces (epic, milestone), but should check if issue has a TYPE label matching strategic types.\n\nFix: Update query_strategic() to check type_hierarchy for strategic types (levels 1-2), then filter issues by type:epic or type:milestone labels.\n\nConfiguration consideration: Currently hardcoded level <= 2 for strategic threshold. Should add strategic_threshold config parameter for full flexibility (e.g., strategic_threshold=1 means only level-1 types). For now, level <= 2 works for default hierarchy.",
