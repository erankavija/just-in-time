  "description": "Create docs/concepts/scope.md explaining JIT's domain coverage and boundaries.\n\n## Current State\n\nFile does not exist yet. Need to create docs/concepts/scope.md from scratch.\n\n## Content Needed\n\n### 1. Full Domain Coverage (~100-120 lines)\n\n**Software Development** (primary examples throughout docs):\n- Issues = Features, bugs, technical debt\n- Gates = Tests, linting, code review, CI/CD\n- Dependencies = Feature prerequisites, build order\n- **Example workflow:** TDD \u2192 Implementation \u2192 Review \u2192 Deploy\n\n**Research Projects:**\n- Issues = Experiments, analyses, papers\n- Gates = Literature review, peer review, data validation\n- Dependencies = Sequential experiments, prerequisite studies\n- **Example workflow:** Hypothesis \u2192 Data collection \u2192 Analysis \u2192 Publication\n\n**Knowledge Work:**\n- Issues = Documents, presentations, reports\n- Gates = Fact-checking, editing, stakeholder approval\n- Dependencies = Chapter order, prerequisite research\n- **Example workflow:** Outline \u2192 Draft \u2192 Review \u2192 Publish\n\n**Creative Work:**\n- Issues = Writing tasks, design iterations, revisions\n- Gates = Word count, spell check, editor approval\n- Dependencies = Sequential chapters, design iterations\n\n**Operations/DevOps:**\n- Issues = Runbooks, incident responses, migrations\n- Gates = Change approval, testing, rollback plan\n- Dependencies = Infrastructure prerequisites\n\n### 2. Domain Mapping Examples (~80-100 lines)\n\n**Table format showing terminology mapping:**\n\n| JIT Concept | Software | Research | Knowledge Work | Operations |\n|-------------|----------|----------|----------------|------------|\n| Issue | Feature/Bug | Experiment | Document | Runbook |\n| Gate | CI Check | Peer Review | Approval | Change Control |\n| Dependency | Prerequisite | Prior Study | Chapter Order | Infra Prereq |\n| Priority | Severity | Impact | Deadline | Urgency |\n| Assignee | Developer | Researcher | Writer | Engineer |\n\n**Workflow examples per domain**\n\n### 3. What JIT Is NOT (~60-80 lines)\n\n**Not a project management tool:**\n- No Gantt charts or timeline views\n- No resource allocation\n- No budget tracking\n- No time estimates (can add as labels if needed)\n\n**Not a communication platform:**\n- No built-in chat or comments (use external tools)\n- No email notifications (integrate via scripts)\n- No @mentions or tagging\n\n**Not a CI/CD system:**\n- Gates can trigger CI, but JIT doesn't run builds\n- Integrates with CI/CD, doesn't replace it\n- No artifact storage or deployment\n\n**Not a knowledge base:**\n- Tracks work items, not documentation\n- Can reference docs, but not a wiki\n- No search across document content (yet)\n\n**Not a distributed system:**\n- Repository-local coordination only\n- File-based, not client-server\n- No multi-repository dependencies (by design)\n\n### 4. Scope Boundaries (~60-80 lines)\n\n**What JIT handles well:**\n- Dependency-driven workflows (DAG coordination)\n- Quality gating (process enforcement)\n- Multi-agent orchestration (atomic claiming)\n- Audit trails (event logging)\n- Domain-agnostic tracking\n\n**What requires integration:**\n- Communication (Slack, email, chat)\n- Time tracking (external tools + labels)\n- Resource management (external tools)\n- Document authoring (editors, IDEs)\n- Build/deployment (CI/CD systems)\n\n**When to use JIT:**\n- Work has clear dependencies\n- Quality gates are important\n- Agent/automation is involved\n- CLI/JSON access preferred\n- Simple, local-first tracking needed\n\n**When to use alternatives:**\n- Need rich web UI for non-technical users\n- Need cloud-hosted collaboration\n- Need project management features (Gantt, budgets)\n- Need built-in communication (use Jira, Asana, Linear)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Domain coverage explained with 3+ examples (300-400 lines)\n- [ ] Domain mapping table included\n- [ ] Clear \"What JIT Is NOT\" section\n- [ ] Scope boundaries help users make decisions\n- [ ] Neutral tone (not marketing, educational)\n- [ ] Examples diverse, not software-only\n\n## References\n\n- File: docs/concepts/scope.md (create new)\n- Strategy: dev/studies/documentation-organization-strategy.md (Domain-Agnostic Language section)\n- Reference: docs/how-to/*.md (domain-specific examples)\n- Parent story: c8254dbf (Core Concepts Documentation)",
