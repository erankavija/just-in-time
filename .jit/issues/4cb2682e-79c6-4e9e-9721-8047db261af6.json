  "title": "Execute AI agent validation testing",
  "description": "Conduct comprehensive validation of the just-in-time system with real AI agents (Claude via Anthropic API and GitHub Copilot) across multiple dimensions: gate system usability, MCP server tool coverage, documentation adequacy, workflow efficiency, and multi-agent coordination. Execute three-phase testing: controlled scenarios (10 standard workflows, 3 runs each), production simulation (100+ issues, 2-4 concurrent agents, 1-2 days), and iteration/fixes. Measure success criteria: \u226590% workflow completion without human intervention, \u226420k tokens per standard workflow, \u226410 tool calls per workflow, \u226580% error self-recovery, zero data corruption in concurrent tests. Document all bugs, documentation gaps, and UX friction discovered. Deliver validation report, prioritized bug list, documentation updates, and production readiness recommendation. This validation is critical as the system is designed for agent orchestration and must be proven effective before v1.0.",
