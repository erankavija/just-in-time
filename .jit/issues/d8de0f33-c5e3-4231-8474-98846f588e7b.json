  "description": "## Problem\n\nThe Issue model doesn't track creation and update timestamps, causing 'Invalid Date' to display in the web UI.\n\n## Solution\n\nAdd timestamp tracking to issues by:\n\n1. **Add fields to Issue struct** (domain.rs):\n   - `created_at: Option<String>` (RFC 3339 timestamp)\n   - `updated_at: Option<String>` (RFC 3339 timestamp)\n\n2. **Populate created_at**:\n   - Query events.jsonl for first `issue_created` event for each issue\n   - Fall back to file modification time if no event found\n\n3. **Populate updated_at**:\n   - Query events.jsonl for most recent event affecting the issue\n   - Fall back to file modification time if no events found\n\n4. **Update on modifications**:\n   - Set `updated_at` whenever issue is modified via `jit issue update`\n   - Keep `created_at` immutable after first set\n\n## Technical Notes\n\n- Events already have timestamps in RFC 3339 format\n- Event types that update issues: issue_state_changed, issue_completed, gate_added, etc.\n- Migration: compute timestamps for existing issues from events on first load",
