# Changelog

All notable changes to Just-In-Time (JIT) are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Uniform JSON list envelope across list- and query-family commands.** Every
  command that emits a collection now wraps it in `{"count": N, "<collection>":
  [...]}`, where `count` equals the length of the collection and the key is
  plural and collection-typed. A single parse path now works for every
  list/query command — agents no longer need bare-array or dual-shape
  fallbacks. Collection keys: `issues` (`issue list`, `list`, `query
  all`/`available`/`blocked`/`strategic`/`closed`, `issue search`, multi-id
  `issue show`), `results` (`search`), `gates` (`gate list`), `presets` (`gate
  preset list`), `events` (`events tail`/`query`), `documents` (`doc list`),
  `assets` (`doc assets list`), `leases` (`claim list`/`status`), `namespaces`
  (`label namespaces`), `values` (`label values`), `templates` (`config
  list-templates`), `items` (`item list`/`search`), `worktrees` (`worktree
  list`), `roots` (`graph roots`), `dependents` (`graph rdeps`, `rdeps`),
  `nodes` (`graph deps`), `results` (`gate status --all`/`--limit`),
  `gate_statuses` (`gate status-all`), and `findings` (`invariant check`). Inner
  record shapes are unchanged. Where a command already carried an aggregate
  count, `count` is the size of the named collection specifically: `graph deps`
  keeps `summary.total` (unique dependencies across the whole tree) while `count`
  is the number of top-level `nodes`; `gate status-all` keeps `total` / `passed`
  (readiness tallies) while `count` is the number of `gate_statuses` entries.

### Migration

- **BREAKING — `jit issue show <id> <id> …` with `--json`.** Passing two or more
  ids previously emitted a bare JSON array (`[ {…}, {…} ]`). It now emits the
  list envelope `{"count": N, "issues": [ {…}, {…} ]}`. Consumers that indexed
  the top-level array must read `.issues` instead (e.g. `jq '.issues[]'` in
  place of `jq '.[]'`). Single-id `issue show --json` is unchanged: it still
  returns a bare issue object.
- **BREAKING — `jit graph deps --json` node collection renamed.** The node
  collection key changed from `tree` to `nodes` (`{"count": N, "nodes": [...]}`).
  Consumers must read `.nodes` instead of `.tree`; each node's inner shape
  (including nested `children`) is unchanged, and `summary` / `issue_id` /
  `depth` remain alongside.
- **Additive — `count` field added.** `gate preset list`, `doc assets list`, and
  `gate status-all` gained a top-level `count` alongside their existing
  collection. `doc assets list` continues to carry its `summary` object; its
  `count` mirrors `summary.total` (the length of `assets`). `gate status-all`
  keeps its `results` / `not_run` / `total` / `passed` keys; its `count` is the
  length of `gate_statuses`, not a readiness tally. Existing consumers that
  ignored unknown keys are unaffected.
- **Documentation — `gate status --all`/`--limit`.** The history view already
  emitted `{"count": N, "results": [...]}`; the envelope is now stated in the
  command help and the CLI reference (no shape change).
