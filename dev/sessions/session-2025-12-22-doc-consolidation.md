# Session Notes: Documentation Consolidation (2025-12-22)

**Issue:** 6f6b842a-67cd-4032-91ba-253dab6f9754  
**Session Date:** 2025-12-22  
**Agent:** copilot-session-1735850293

## Work Completed ✅

### 1. Removed Test Artifacts
**Commit:** b91a041

Removed `auth-design.md` and `billing-design.md` from dev/vision/
- These were test data accidentally added in commit 9e143f9 (Dec 11)
- Described SaaS features (authentication, Stripe billing) completely unrelated to JIT
- JIT is a local CLI issue tracker - no users, no auth, no billing

### 2. Consolidated Label Documentation
**Commit:** f3e9b41

Merged 5 separate label documents into single canonical reference:

**Source files (2,059 lines total):**
- `label-conventions.md` (684 lines) - Primary source
- `label-quick-reference.md` (347 lines)
- `dependency-vs-labels-clarity.md` (300 lines)
- `label-enforcement-proposal.md` (473 lines)
- `labels-config-consolidation.md` (255 lines)

**Result: `docs/reference/labels.md` (871 lines)**

**Sections added:**
- Overview with labels vs dependencies distinction
- Configuration section with examples
- Quick Reference with Golden Rules and DO/DON'Ts
- Comprehensive examples throughout

**What was preserved:**
- Git history (git mv from label-conventions.md)
- All validation rules and enforcement details
- Agent usage patterns and MCP tool schemas
- Namespace management commands
- Configuration customization options

**Archived:**
- All 4 source files moved to `dev/archive/studies/`

### 3. Documentation Review
Verified consolidated document has:
- ✅ Complete namespace reference
- ✅ Labels vs dependencies explanation
- ✅ Format specification and validation
- ✅ Quick reference with examples
- ✅ Configuration customization
- ✅ Agent-friendly CLI examples
- ✅ 26 validation-related references
- ✅ Strategic consistency covered

## Remaining Work 🚧

### Agent Documentation Consolidation ✅ COMPLETE
**Commit:** [pending]

Created comprehensive AGENT-QUICKSTART.md (422 lines) consolidating:
- `getting-started-complete.md` (915 lines)
- `agent-project-initialization-guide.md` (621 lines)
- `agent-context-mcp.md` (449 lines)

**Result: AGENT-QUICKSTART.md (422 lines, 50% reduction)**

**Content includes:**
- Core concepts (states, labels, dependencies)
- MCP tool reference with parameter names
- TDD workflow with gate examples
- Issue creation patterns (CLI and MCP)
- Multi-agent coordination
- Document lifecycle usage
- Validation and safety
- Pro tips and common patterns

**Archived:**
- All 3 source files moved to `dev/archive/studies/`

**Approach used:**
- Created new concise guide following CONTRIBUTOR-QUICKSTART pattern
- Merged essential content from all 3 sources
- Focused on practical "get productive in 5 minutes" goal
- Added gate workflows and document lifecycle (missing from originals)
- Removed redundant tutorial sections

### Update References ✅ COMPLETE

Updated references in:
1. ✅ EXAMPLE.md - Changed to reference AGENT-QUICKSTART.md and docs/reference/labels.md
2. ✅ dev/index.md - Removed archived agent doc references, added links to quickstart guides
3. ✅ README.md - No changes needed (no references found)

### Final Validation (In Progress)

1. Run `jit validate`
2. Check for broken links
3. Test that all referenced commands work
4. Verify git history preserved
5. Update issue and mark done

**Estimated effort:** ~15 minutes

## Notes for Next Session

### Context
- Issue 6f6b842a claimed and in progress
- We're in the docs-lifecycle epic
- This follows issue 165cf162 (documentation reorganization)
- Structure is now: docs/ (product) vs dev/ (development)

### Quick Start Commands
```bash
# Check issue status
jit issue show 6f6b842a

# List remaining files to consolidate
ls -lh dev/architecture/agent*.md dev/studies/getting-started-complete.md

# View current AGENT-QUICKSTART.md
cat AGENT-QUICKSTART.md | head -50

# When ready to proceed
git mv dev/studies/getting-started-complete.md AGENT-QUICKSTART.md
# Then merge content from agent-context-mcp.md and agent-project-initialization-guide.md
```

### Key Decisions Made
1. Used git mv to preserve history for primary source files
2. Archived source files to dev/archive/studies/ (not deleted)
3. Removed test artifacts (auth/billing) completely
4. Configuration examples added to help users customize

### Success Criteria Checklist
- ✅ 5 label docs → 1 comprehensive guide (docs/reference/labels.md)
- ✅ 3 agent docs → 1 enhanced guide (AGENT-QUICKSTART.md)
- ✅ Speculative docs removed
- ✅ All references updated
- ✅ Git history preserved for label docs (not agent docs - created new)
- ⬜ Repository validates

**Progress: 95% complete (5 of 6 acceptance criteria met, validation pending)**

## Git Commits

1. `b91a041` - Remove test artifacts (auth/billing designs)
