> **Diátaxis Type:** Learning-oriented step-by-step guides  
> **Audience:** New users wanting to learn JIT by doing

Tutorials are designed to help you learn JIT through hands-on practice. Each tutorial is a complete, self-contained lesson that teaches specific concepts by walking you through a real example.

## Available Tutorials

### 1. [Quickstart](quickstart.md)
**Time:** 10 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** JIT installed  
**What you'll learn:**
- Initialize a JIT tracker
- Create and manage issues
- Build dependency graphs
- Add quality gates

**Start here if:** You're brand new to JIT and want to get productive quickly.

---

### 2. [First Workflow](first-workflow.md)
**Time:** 30 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** Completed Quickstart  
**What you'll learn:**
- Epic → task breakdown patterns
- Quality gate workflows
- Multi-agent claiming and coordination
- Dynamic issue discovery
- Complete feature delivery

**Start here if:** You want to understand how JIT manages complex multi-step workflows with multiple agents.

---

### 3. [Parallel Work with Git Worktrees](parallel-work-worktrees.md)
**Time:** 15 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** Basic git worktree knowledge  
**What you'll learn:**
- Create secondary worktrees
- Configure agent identities
- Claim issues for parallel work
- Work in isolation and merge back
- Handle lease expiration and renewal

**Start here if:** You need multiple agents working on different issues simultaneously without conflicts.

## Learning Path

**Recommended order:**

1. **Quickstart** - Get the basics down (10 min)
2. **First Workflow** - See the full power of dependencies and gates (30 min)
3. **Parallel Work** - Learn multi-agent coordination (15 min)

**Total time:** ~1 hour to become proficient with JIT

## After Tutorials

Once you've completed these tutorials, you'll be ready for:

- **[How-To Guides](../how-to/)** - Solve specific problems in your domain
- **[Concepts](../concepts/)** - Deep dive into JIT's design and principles
- **[Reference](../reference/)** - Look up command syntax and specifications

## Tutorial Philosophy

All tutorials follow these principles:

- **Learning-oriented**: Designed to help you learn, not just accomplish a task
- **Hands-on**: You type commands and see results
- **Safe to try**: Examples use disposable test projects
- **Progressive**: Each builds on the previous
- **Complete**: You can follow them start to finish without external resources
