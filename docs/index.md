# JIT Product Documentation

Welcome to **Just-In-Time (JIT)** - a CLI-first issue tracker designed for programmatic agents with dependency graphs and quality gates.

## Documentation Structure

This documentation follows the [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) framework:

### 📚 [Concepts](concepts/) - Understanding JIT
*Explanation-oriented: Learn about core concepts and design principles*

- What is JIT and why it exists
- Core model: issues, dependencies, gates, states
- System guarantees and invariants
- Domain-agnostic design principles

### 🎓 [Tutorials](tutorials/) - Learning-Oriented
*Step-by-step lessons to get started*

- Quickstart guide (coming soon)
- Your first workflow (coming soon)

### 🔧 [How-To Guides](how-to/) - Goal-Oriented
*Practical recipes for specific use cases*

- Software development workflows (coming soon)
- Research project tracking (coming soon)
- Knowledge work management (coming soon)
- Custom gates and validation (coming soon)
- Dependency management strategies (coming soon)

### 📖 [Reference](reference/) - Information-Oriented
*Technical specifications and API documentation*

- CLI command reference (coming soon)
- Storage format specification (coming soon)
- Configuration options ([example-config.toml](reference/example-config.toml))
- Programmatic API (coming soon)

### 📄 Additional Resources

- [Main README](../README.md) - Project overview and quick links
- [Development Documentation](../dev/index.md) - For contributors working on JIT itself

## Getting Started

1. **New to JIT?** Start with [Concepts](concepts/) to understand the core model
2. **Want to try it?** Follow the [Tutorials](tutorials/) (coming in Phase 2)
3. **Solving a specific problem?** Check [How-To Guides](how-to/)
4. **Need technical details?** See [Reference](reference/)

## About This Documentation

**Product documentation** (`docs/`) is permanent, user-facing reference material that:
- Uses domain-agnostic terminology (works for software, research, knowledge work)
- Stays stable across releases
- Never gets archived

**Development documentation** (`dev/`) covers how we build JIT itself - see [dev/index.md](../dev/index.md) for contributor resources.

**Note:** This documentation is under active development. Many sections are planned for Phase 2 of the documentation reorganization project.
